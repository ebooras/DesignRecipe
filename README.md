# DesignRecipe - An Android Mobile App 
As part of a semester-long project I completed during my time as an undergrad, I created DesignRecipe as an organizational app for Android. Users can develop their own recipes in the app and, over time, continually update them as they make tweaks to their recipes. DesignRecipe retains each previous version of the recipe, in case the user wants to go back to another iteration and make changes. In a sense, DesignRecipe is Github for recipes, providing a version control system for creating and updating recipes.
